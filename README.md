# Heart Disease UCI
The Heart Disease UCI dataset contains medical data from patients and is used to predict the presence or absence of heart disease. It includes 303 instances (rows) and 14 attributes (columns), such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate achieved. The dataset is often used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0) based on these features. It provides a valuable resource for experimenting with machine learning algorithms, particularly for health-related predictive modeling.

### Meta data
The dataset contains medical data from patients and is used for predicting the presence of heart disease. Below is a description of each column:

1. **Age**: The age of the patient (numerical).
2. **Sex**: The sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female).
3. **cp (Chest pain type)**:
   - 1: typical angina
   - 2: atypical angina
   - 3: non-anginal pain
   - 4: asymptomatic
4. **trestbps (Resting blood pressure)**: The patient's resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
5. **chol (Serum cholesterol)**: The serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl).
6. **fbs (Fasting blood sugar)**:
   - 1: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
   - 0: fasting blood sugar â‰¤ 120 mg/dl
7. **restecg (Resting electrocardiographic results)**:
   - 0: normal
   - 1: ST-T wave abnormality
   - 2: probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy
8. **thalach (Maximum heart rate achieved)**: The highest heart rate achieved during a stress test.
9. **exang (Exercise induced angina)**:
   - 1: patient has exercise-induced angina
   - 0: patient does not have exercise-induced angina
10. **oldpeak (Depression induced by exercise relative to rest)**: The depression of the ST segment during exercise relative to rest.
11. **slope (Slope of the peak exercise ST segment)**:
   - 1: upsloping
   - 2: flat
   - 3: downsloping
12. **ca (Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy)**: The number of major vessels (0-3) that are colored by fluoroscopy.
13. **thal (Thalassemia)**:
   - 3: normal
   - 6: fixed defect
   - 7: reversible defect
14. **target**: The presence or absence of heart disease (binary classification):
   - 0: no heart disease
   - 1: presence of heart disease
